# dear fellow coders:

[中文版](./Readme chinese.md)

Tonight I want to share with you an **opportunity to do something for the world**. After graduating for so many years, do u still remember "make the world a better place". However, after so many years dormant behind the business, finally this opportunity has come.
Mankind has encounted this unprecedented challenge nCov2019 virus. Doctors can cure diseases and save people, delievery man can transport masks, engineers can build medical equipment, and oil factories can manufacture spray velvet for N95. What can we, coders do? ? ?
# **answer is We can develop antiviral vaccines!!!**
I want to direct your attention to **fold.it**, this project.Jointly developed by University of Washington Center for Game Science, University of Washington Institute for Protein Design, Northeastern University, Vanderbilt University, University of California, Davis, and University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, A game fold.it, aims to ultilize all the wisdom of the people in order to find a protein that destroys diseases. In simple terms, as long as you can win the game, you can provide a potential treatment.
# I propose: 
## 1. Mobilize **the power of the community, the power of the enterprise** (I am capgemini, we recently have a huge fund of tech 4 positive future support, I am currently working with the bosses) to make this game attractive, a game that humans like to play and are willing to play Current problems 
1.1 The interface is ugly, 1.2 the number of servers is not enough, the response time is extremely long, 1.3 the user doesnot keep playing 1.4 entering the same is to difficult
## 2. Modeling **e-sports events** such as CS, holding large-scale online competitions, explaining, and reshaping biotechnology and computer technology into stars.
## 3. Using **machine learning and deep learning technology** to  find the matching protein by machine
## 4. Use **federated learning** to bring everyone who has hardware but not time, who has data but is cautious about privacy, to find a treatment plan for ncov2019.
## 5. Using **blockchain**, a distributed, non-tamperable bookkeeping system, and associated intellectual property protection related laws, to the greatest extent possible to solve the worries of creators and protect the legitimate rights and interests of inventors
